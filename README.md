Title: Blossom Bank Fraud Detection Analysis

This model will enable Blossom Bank (BB PLC) to detect and prevent fraudulent activities, protecting both the bank and its customers from financial losses and potential security breaches.

Description:

This repository contains an in-depth analysis and machine learning model development for Blossom Bank (BB PLC), a multinational financial services group headquartered in London, UK. The primary objective of this analysis is to understand customer behaviour, explore the dataset, and develop a robust machine learning model for online payment fraud detection. 
Secondly, it is designed to be a comprehensive and reliable resource for fraud detection analysis, providing a solid foundation for further research, improvements, and adaptation to evolving fraud detection challenges in the financial services industry.

Key Features:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The repository includes a comprehensive EDA to gain insights into the dataset, identify patterns, and understand the distribution of key variables related to online transactions, customer information, and fraud indicators.

Data Preprocessing: The analysis covers data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and creating new derived features when necessary. This ensures the data is suitable for training machine learning models.

Model Selection and Training: The repository includes the implementation of multiple supervised learning models for fraud detection. It explores different algorithms, such as KNeighbors Classifier, decision trees and random forests, to identify the most effective model for predicting fraudulent transactions.

Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using appropriate performance metrics, including accuracy, precision and recall. The evaluation results provide insights into the models' effectiveness in accurately identifying fraudulent transactions and minimizing false negatives or false positives.

Visualizations: The analysis incorporates informative visualizations, such as histograms, pie charts, line charts, and confusion matrices, to present key findings, trends, and relationships within the dataset.

Recommendations and Insights: The repository concludes with actionable recommendations and insights based on the analysis results. These recommendations can assist Blossom Bank in improving their fraud detection strategies, enhancing security measures, and minimizing financial losses due to fraudulent activities.

Documentation and Code: The analysis includes detailed documentation and well-commented code to facilitate understanding, replication, and further development. The code is structured in a modular and organized manner to ensure readability and maintainability.

By leveraging the insights and machine learning models developed in this analysis, Blossom Bank can strengthen its fraud detection capabilities, proactively identify and prevent fraudulent transactions, enhance customer trust, and mitigate financial risks associated with online payment fraud.
